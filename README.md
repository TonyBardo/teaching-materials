# 🎓 Tony Bardo — Teaching Materials

Welcome to a curated collection of quantitative methods courses designed for both undergraduate and graduate social science students. This repository hosts two complete, interactive curricula focused on real-world data analysis with reproducible code:

---

## 📘 Undergraduate Quantitative Methods (`undergrad-quant`)

A hands-on, theory-in-context course introducing:

- Foundations of the scientific process (conceptualization → operationalization → measurement)
- Descriptive statistics and data cleaning with **R**
- Inferential statistics: probability, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing
- Multivariate analysis: simple and multiple regression, interactions

Materials include:

- 14 PowerPoint lectures introducing concepts and R-based examples
- 8 team-based applied exercises (Netflix simulation scenario)
- A master R script, survey data files, and synthetic team datasets

Ideal for instructors or students new to quantitative analysis who want a **critical, applied approach**.

## 📚 Graduate Quantitative Methods (`graduate-quant`)

An advanced, GLM-focused course designed for students with existing statistical background. Highlights:

- OLS diagnostics and theory-based modeling
- Logit, probit, ordered logit/probit, multinomial logit, Poisson, and negative binomial models
- Postestimation: odds ratios, marginal effects (AME, MEM, MER), predicted probabilities
- Mediation, moderation, and introductory SEM
- Student-driven research project culminating in journal-style paper and presentation

Materials include:

- 11 lecture PowerPoints with Stata applications and `.do` syntax
- 5 scaffolded assignments + final project and presentation guides
- Cleaned GSS dataset (`.dta`) and master Stata `.do` file

## 🚀 Getting Started

**1.** Navigate to the subfolder that interests you:

- undergrad-quant for the introductory course

- graduate-quant for the advanced course

**2.** Each subfolder includes:

- PowerPoints for lecture support

- Data files and scripts for hands-on lessons

- Assignments with prompts and grading rubrics

---

## 🧠 Why These Courses Work

- Integrate theory, measurement, and analysis

- Use real data from the General Social Survey and synthetic case studies

- Provide reproducible workflows in R and Stata

- Support student development through projects, not just problem sets

- Include scaffolded materials for both undergrad and graduate audiences
