# üéì Graduate Quantitative Methods
Welcome to the companion repository for Graduate Quantitative Methods, a course designed for students with a solid foundation in statistics and data management. This course focuses on advanced modeling techniques, applied learning using real-world data, and rigorous independent projects using the General Social Survey (GSS) and self-selected datasets.

üéØ Audience: Graduate students in sociology, public health, political science, and other social sciences; educators designing advanced quantitative courses.

## üîç Course Overview
This course helps students move beyond descriptive and linear methods, developing mastery over a range of generalized linear models (GLM). Each PowerPoint integrates theory, technical skill, and applied Stata-based examples from the GSS. Students apply this knowledge through a scaffolded sequence of assignments using their own data.

- Focus on generalized linear models (GLMs)
- Heavy emphasis on postestimation and visual interpretation
- Scaffolded assignments build toward an independent final project
- All examples use real data from the GSS dataset
- Instructional materials fully reproducible using the provided .do file
