# 🎓 Graduate Quantitative Methods
Welcome to the companion repository for Graduate Quantitative Methods, a course designed for students with a solid foundation in statistics and data management. This course focuses on advanced modeling techniques, applied learning using real-world data, and rigorous independent projects using the General Social Survey (GSS) and self-selected datasets.

🎯 Audience: Graduate students in sociology, public health, political science, and other social sciences; educators designing advanced quantitative courses.

## 🔍 Course Overview
This course helps students move beyond descriptive and linear methods, developing mastery over a range of generalized linear models (GLM). Each PowerPoint integrates theory, technical skill, and applied Stata-based examples from the GSS. Students apply this knowledge through a scaffolded sequence of assignments using their own data.

- Focus on generalized linear models (GLMs)
- Heavy emphasis on postestimation and visual interpretation
- Scaffolded assignments build toward an independent final project
- All examples use real data from the GSS dataset
- Instructional materials fully reproducible using the provided .do file

## 🎓 For Students

This course is designed for graduate students who have a solid foundation in statistical reasoning and prior exposure to linear regression. By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- ✅ Independently locate, clean, and analyze secondary data
- ✅ Apply mediation and moderation techniques using OLS
- ✅ Build and interpret generalized linear models (GLMs), including logit, probit, ologit, oprobit, multinomial logit, and count models
- ✅ Conduct and visualize postestimation analyses such as marginal effects and predicted probabilities
- ✅ Prepare publication-ready tables and figures using Stata
- ✅ Write a journal-style manuscript that integrates theory, methods, and results
- ✅ Present your findings in a professional, conference-style presentation

## 🧑‍🏫 For Educators


This course provides a structured, modular approach to teaching graduate-level quantitative methods with real-world datasets and reproducible workflows in **Stata**. It is suitable for:

- Instructors teaching applied quantitative methods with a GLM emphasis
- Institutions with a need for reproducible research training and secondary data analysis
- Sociology, Public Health, Psychology, and Policy students

<details>

<summary><strong>🧪 Tools & Skills Taught</strong></summary>

- Data preparation and recoding in Stata
- OLS diagnostics (linearity, multicollinearity, homoscedasticity)
- Generalized Linear Models (Logit, Probit, Ordered Logit, Mlogit, Poisson, NB)
- Postestimation: odds ratios, marginal effects (AME, MEM, MER), predicted probabilities
- Mediation and moderation frameworks
- SEM concepts (introductory level)
- Academic writing and scientific communication

</details>

<details>
  
<summary><strong>🧩 Modular & Adaptable</strong></summary>

Each assignment builds on prior skills, allowing instructors to adapt the pace or depth. For example:

- Replace the GSS with your department’s preferred dataset
- Substitute the Stata `.do` file with R or Python equivalents
- Adjust readings or replace PPTs with custom lectures

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>📦 What’s Included</strong></summary>

- ✅ 11 Lecture PPTs covering OLS, GLM, postestimation, and SEM
- ✅ Scaffolded assignments culminating in a journal-style final paper
- ✅ GSS dataset and corresponding Stata `.do` file used in lectures
- ✅ Presentation and paper rubrics for evaluation
- ✅ A flexible syllabus that can be adapted to quarter or semester formats
