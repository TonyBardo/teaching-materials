# 🎓 Graduate Quantitative Methods
Welcome to the companion repository for Graduate Quantitative Methods, a course designed for students with a solid foundation in statistics and data management. This course focuses on advanced modeling techniques, applied learning using real-world data, and rigorous independent projects using the General Social Survey (GSS) and self-selected datasets.

🎯 Audience: Graduate students in sociology, public health, political science, and other social sciences; educators designing advanced quantitative courses.## 📥 How to Download and Unzip the GSS Dataset

## 🔍 Course Overview
This course helps students move beyond descriptive and linear methods, developing mastery over a range of generalized linear models (GLM). Each PowerPoint integrates theory, technical skill, and applied Stata-based examples from the GSS. Students apply this knowledge through a scaffolded sequence of assignments using their own data.

### Students will:
Refine their understanding of OLS regression and key assumptions

Learn binary, ordinal, multinomial, and count models using GLM

Master postestimation tools such as predicted probabilities, marginal effects, and visualization

Explore the logic and applications of moderation and mediation

Briefly engage with SEM, factor analysis, and latent class modeling
