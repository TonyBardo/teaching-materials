# 🎓 Introduction to Quantitative Methods (Undergraduate)

Welcome to the companion repository for *Introduction to Quantitative Methods*, an undergraduate course that blends theory, measurement, and applied statistics using R. This course is organized around a semester-long consulting simulation with Netflix, giving students hands-on experience with real and synthetic survey data.

📁 **Course Folder**: [`undergrad-quant`](https://github.com/TonyBardo/teaching-materials/tree/main/undergrad-quant)  
👨‍🏫 **Instructor**: Tony Bardo  
🎯 **Audience**: Undergraduate students (especially social sciences) and educators interested in adopting a critical and applied approach to teaching methods.

## 🔍 Course Overview

> “Teaching quantitative methods without emphasizing perspective and theory would be like teaching you to drive with your eyes closed.”

This course goes beyond formulas and software. Students will:
- Investigate how problems are framed and measured in science
- Build, test, and evaluate hypotheses from theory to application
- Use **RStudio** to clean, explore, and model data
- Simulate real-world work as consultants for **Netflix**

Throughout the course, students critically explore how **perspective, theory, and measurement** shape how we understand and solve problems with data.

## 🎓 For Prospective Students

If you're considering this course, here's what you'll get:

✅ **No prior R experience needed**  
✅ **Learn by doing**, not memorizing equations  
✅ **Team-based simulation** with a real-world feel  
✅ **Build critical thinking** by connecting theory, measurement, and data  
✅ **Finish with reproducible workflows** and a working knowledge of R

## 🧑‍🏫 For Educators

These materials are open for use, remixing, and adaptation. This course was built with:
- A single master **R script** that students use to follow and replicate applied lecture content.
- **GSS data** for general-purpose learning, and
- A fully designed **Netflix simulation** including a student-designed Qualtrics survey, coding templates, and reproducible analysis.

Each lecture and exercise is fully scaffolded with:
- Clear learning objectives
- Real-world relevance
- Applied statistical programming
- Alignment between theory and analysis
