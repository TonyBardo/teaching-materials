# 🎓 Introduction to Quantitative Methods (Undergraduate)

Welcome to the companion repository for *Introduction to Quantitative Methods*, an undergraduate course that blends theory, measurement, and applied statistics using R. This course is organized around a semester-long consulting simulation, giving students hands-on experience with real and synthetic survey data.

🎯 **Audience**: Undergraduate students (especially social sciences) and educators interested in adopting a critical and applied approach to teaching methods.

## 🔍 Course Overview

> “Teaching quantitative methods without emphasizing perspective and theory would be like teaching you to drive with your eyes closed.”

This course goes beyond formulas and software. Students will:
- Investigate how problems are framed and measured in science
- Build, test, and evaluate hypotheses from theory to application
- Use **RStudio** to clean, explore, and model data
- Simulate real-world work as consultants for **Netflix**

Throughout the course, students critically explore how **perspective, theory, and measurement** shape how we understand and solve problems with data.
